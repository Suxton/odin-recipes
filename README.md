# odin-recipes
## Introduction
This project focus is on practicing HTML and CSS by creating a basic recipe website, which will have an index page that will link to a few recipes.
## What I've learned/accomplished doing this Project
- I got used to using git's add and commit commands; finally understood why there is a "stage" and "commit" and not just "commit" state or "push": to select specific changes and transform them into "Atomic Commits", with short descriptions to what & how has changed, so that to have a more readable and simplified history version; truly clever! (also, it's really time wasting to push every single commit, so it's easier if you just let them acummulate and when you're done with the file or whatever you just push them all at once!)
- I think i won't ever forget the difference between ordered lists (ol) and unordered (ul) lists haha.
###After CSS Update
- How to put a light shadow around images with box-shadow
- Reinforced some aspects of the cascade
- Borders look cool if used properly
